## Project Description: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Posts

This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of social media posts. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used in data science and machine learning to identify and extract subjective information from text. It helps determine whether the sentiment behind a particular text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Tools and Technologies Used

For this task, we utilized a combination of Python libraries, data science tools, and NLP techniques, specifically:

- Python: The primary programming language used for all analysis and modelling tasks.

- Pandas: Used for data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Employed for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and basic NLP cleaning.

- Scikit-Learn:

  - TfidfVectorizer: Used to convert text data into numerical format (vectorization) for machine learning models.
